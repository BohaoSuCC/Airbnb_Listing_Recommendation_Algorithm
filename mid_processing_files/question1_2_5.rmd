## 1. Who collected the data?(2 points)
The data was collected by Murray Cox, specifically for the Inside Airbnb project. Murray Cox utilized automated tools to extract publicly available data from the Airbnb website, including location information and pricing， and then compile it into the dataset. 


## 2. Why did they collect it?(4 points)
Murray Cox collected the Inside Airbnb dataset to analyze Airbnb's impact on housing markets and communities in cities globally. The project aims to provide an independent perspective, helping the public, researchers, and policymakers understand how Airbnb affects urban housing affordability and community dynamics. This data offers insights for policy discussions and social understanding of Airbnb's role in urban environments.


## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data raise?(18 points)
(1)Privacy issues: whether the dataset has the consent of the landlord owner to disclose its information, e.g., house location, name. Geocoded data is privacy-sensitive and highly likely to expose personal privacy when used to study demographic patterns and behaviours (Vera van den Bemt, 2018). Therefore, obtaining the user's consent is crucial to whether the user's privacy is effectively safeguarded.

(2)Legal compliance: whether the use of the dataset complies with laws and regulations such as GDPR, DPA and EDPS.The EDPS 2015 report states that it is not enough to comply with the law in today's digital environment; we must consider the ethical dimensions of data processing. (Hasselbach, 2019) Therefore, legal compliance and ethical considerations should be combined in the digital age.

(3)Social responsibility: it is important to use datasets appropriately, as publishing certain data may exacerbate behaviours such as inequality and bias. The Fairness and Openness Report emphasizes how to use information responsibly and ethically, and it is quite crucial to resist the labelling of low-income communities, people of colour, etc. For example, significant differences in housing prices in different neighbourhoods may reflect economic disparities, which can affect perceptions of the socioeconomic status of those areas. Therefore, there is a need to consider how to disclose the labelled attributes of the data in question to avoid negative impacts.

(4)Data security: Some sensitive information in the dataset, such as personal information descriptions and geographic coordinates, must be stored securely to prevent access and misuse by unauthorized persons, thus avoiding security risks such as identity theft and property loss. By adjusting the norms of the use of network data, it is possible to effectively guarantee data security and increase the level of ethical behaviour of companies when processing data (СкибунО.Ж, 2022). Thus, attention to data security can prevent the conduct of unscrupulous individuals who collect housing data for profit or surveillance purposes.
