## 3. How was the data collected?

::: duedate
1.[\*listings.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2023-09-06/data/listings.csv.gz) : Inside Airbnb collects its data primarily by scraping information from the Airbnb website. This process involves the following steps:

i*.Web Scraping*: Inside Airbnb uses automated scripts to systematically browse and extract data from Airbnb's listings. These scripts navigate the website just like a human user would, but they do it much faster and on a larger scale.

*ii.Data Extraction*: Information about each listing, such as location, price, availability, number of bedrooms, reviews, and host details, is extracted and compiled.

*iii.Data Aggregation*: The collected data is then aggregated into a database. This database is organized to make it easier to analyze trends, patterns, and insights related to Airbnb’s offerings in various cities and regions.

*iv.Regular Updates*: The scraping process is repeated periodically to keep the database current, capturing new listings and updates to existing ones.

*v.Public Accessibility*: The aggregated data is often made available to the public through the Inside Airbnb website, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the general public to analyze Airbnb’s impact on housing markets and communities. It's important to note that web scraping practices, like those used by Inside Airbnb, may face legal and ethical considerations depending on the website's terms of service and regional laws regarding data privacy and usage.
