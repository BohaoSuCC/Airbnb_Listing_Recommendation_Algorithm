    "**i.Web Scraping**: Inside Airbnb uses automated scripts to systematically browse and extract data from Airbnb's listings. These scripts navigate the website just like a human user would, but they do it much faster and on a larger scale.\n",

    "**ii.Data Extraction**: Information about each listing, such as location, price, availability, number of bedrooms, reviews, and host details, is extracted and compiled.\n",

    "**v.Public Accessibility**: The aggregated data is often made available to the public through the Inside Airbnb website, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the general public to analyze Airbnb's impact on housing markets and communities.
